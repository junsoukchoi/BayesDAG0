Description: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation for Bayesian differential zero-inflated negative binomial DAG (DAG0). DAG0 aims to two-sample causal discovery for observational zero-inflated count data. DAG0 helps identify differential networks across two sample groups as well as deals with zero-inflation in observational count data.
